## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The FalNess script is a tool designed to compare vulnerability reports generated by Falcon and Nessus, identify findings that are present in both reports, and generate a new report containing only the shared findings. This process helps eliminate false positives and provides a consolidated view of vulnerabilities that require attention.

## 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Before using the FalNess script, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the script:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/exrienz/falness-validator.git
   cd falness-validator
   ```

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Follow these steps to use the FalNess Finding Validator:

1. Retrieve the Nessus report, ensuring it contains only the CVE and Host columns, and store the files in the "nessus" directory.

2. Acquire the Falcon report and place it in the "falcon" folder.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.

4. Execute the script by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 validate.py
   ```

5. The script will generate a new CSV file named 'Validated.csv' in the script's directory. This file will contain the shared host and CVE entries from both the Falcon and Nessus reports, eliminating false positives.

## 4. File Structure <a name="file-structure"></a>
The script directory should have the following structure:

```
falness-validator/
│
├── falcon/
│   └── falcon_report.csv
│
├── nessus/
│   └── nessus_report.csv
│
├── validate.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Validated.csv
└── README.md
```

- **falcon/**: This directory should contain the Falcon vulnerability report in a CSV file named 'falcon_report.csv'.

- **nessus/**: This directory should contain the Nessus vulnerability report in a CSV file named 'nessus_report.csv'.

- **validate.py**: The Python script responsible for comparing and validating the reports.

- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python packages required for the script. You can install them using `pip`.

- **Validated.csv**: The output file containing validated findings shared between Falcon and Nessus reports.

## 5. Example <a name="example"></a>
Suppose you have obtained the Falcon and Nessus reports and placed them in their respective directories. After running the script with the provided command, you will get a 'Validated.csv' file containing only the shared findings between the two reports.

## 6. Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If you encounter any issues or errors while using the Falcon & Nessus Finding Validator script, please check the following:

- Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Verify that the CSV files in the 'falcon' and 'nessus' directories are correctly formatted and contain the necessary columns (CVE and Host).

If you still encounter problems, you can raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/exrienz/falness-validator) for assistance.
